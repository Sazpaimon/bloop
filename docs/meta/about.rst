Thanks for contributing!  Feel free to `open an issue`_ for any bugs, typos, unhelpful docs, or general unhappiness
which you may encounter while using Bloop.  If you want to `create a pull request`_, even more awesome!  Please
make sure all the tox environments pass.

To start developing Bloop first `create a fork`_, then clone and run the tests::

    git clone git@github.com:[YOU]/bloop.git
    cd bloop
    pip install tox -e .
    tox -e unit, docs

.. note::

    The integration tests use `DynamoDBLocal`_ which requires JRE >= 6.x.  The tests automatically download and unpack
    the software into ``.dynamodb_local`` and start the process as follows, where the port is selected at runtime::

        java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -inMemory -port {PORT}

----------
Public API
----------

Bloop follows `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`__ and a `draft appendix`__ for its :ref:`Public API <api-public>`.

The following are enforced:

* Backwards incompatible changes in major version only
* New features in minor version or higher
* Backwards compatible bug fixes in patch version or higher (see `appendix`_)

__ http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
__ appendix_

.. _versioning-internal:

------------
Internal API
------------

The :ref:`Internal API <api-internal>` is not versioned, and may make backwards incompatible changes at any time.
When a class or function is not explicitly documented as part on the public or internal api,
it is part of the internal api.  Still, please `open an issue`_ so it can be appropriately documented.
